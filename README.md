Plugins: Turn any ComfyUI workflow into an application

Comfyui provides an editor and backend services, but lacks a user interface for end users. When creators have created their own workflow, they need to open the same interface again for the next use, and unnecessary features (or nodes) cannot be hidden. Similar to a game engine, after creating a game in the editor, it needs to be packaged into a user-friendly interactive interface.

Plugins are designed based on this idea to provide an interactive interface for ComfyUI applications.


*Comfyui
- Backend, editor
- Export workflow.json file


*Plugins
- Packaging and debugging features
- Interactive interface
